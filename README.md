 <h3 align="center">GEOL0069 Week 4: Unsupervised Sea Ice vs. Lead Classification</h3>
<p align="justify">
    This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to distinguish between sea ice and leads (open water channels) using Sentinel-3 altimetry data. The analysis builds upon the foundational notebook Unit_2_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_updated.ipynb, implementing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to classify radar echoes based on their waveform characteristics. The results are validated against official ESA classifications using a confusion matrix, providing a quantitative assessment of the model's performance in real-world Earth Observation scenarios.
